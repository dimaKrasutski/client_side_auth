## Want to Contribute?

Awesome. We love help, but before getting started, please read:

**[Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](http://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/)**

## Ready for a Pull-Request?

1. Fork the repo.

2. Add changes.

3. Add a test for your changes (if it's possible).

4. Make the test pass.

5. Push to your fork (hopefully this comes from a topical branch) and submit a
   pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. Please keep in mind that OSS maintainers
are often very busy. We'll do our best to at least comment on issues and
pull-requests as soon as possible, but sometimes life gets in the way.  We may
also suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
